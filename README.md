A curated list of **Large Language Models (LLMs)** for **optimization problem modeling** and **solving**, with awesome resources (papers, code, applications, reviews, surveys, etc.) across **transportation**, **logistics**, and related domains. This repository aims to systematically summarize recent advances in the field, providing a comprehensive overview of how LLMs solve complex optimization challenges.

## Prompt-based Methods

#### Chain-of-Experts: When LLMs Meet Complex Operation Research Problems, ICLR 2024. [[paper]](https://openreview.net/forum?id=HobyL1B9CZ)[[official code]](https://github.com/xzymustbexzy/Chain-of-Experts/tree/main)[[poster]](https://iclr.cc/media/PosterPDFs/ICLR%202024/18977.png?t=1714228549.6135468)

- This paper introduces Chain-of-Experts (CoE), a multi-agent LLM framework that boosts reasoning in complex operation research problems by integrating domain-specific agents under a conductor's guidance and reflection mechanism.

## Learning-based Methods

#### LLMOPT: Learning to Define and Solve General Optimization Problems from Scratch, ICLR 2025. [[paper]](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=9OMvtboTJg)[[official code]](https://github.com/caigaojiang/LLMOPT?tab=readme-ov-file)

- LLMOPT introduces a unified framework that effectively bridges natural language optimization problems to mathematical formulations, significantly improving solving accuracy across diverse optimization types.

## Other Resources

#### Machine Mindset: An MBTI Exploration of Large Language Models. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12999)[[official code]](https://github.com/PKU-YuanGroup/Machine-Mindset)

- This study proposes "Machine Mindset," a method integrating MBTI traits into LLMs using two-phase fine-tuning and DPO to ensure consistent personality profiles. Validated across domains, it aligns model behavior with MBTI traits, offering new datasets and training frameworks for personalized AI.
